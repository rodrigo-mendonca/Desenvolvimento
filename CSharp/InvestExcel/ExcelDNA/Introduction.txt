Introducing Excel-DNA - DotNet for Applications
===============================================

Excel-DNA brings .NET to Excel power users and developers. The primary target is the Excel user who currently writes VBA code for functions and macros, and would like to start using .NET. An additional audience is C/C++ -based .xll add-in developers who want to use the .NET framework to develop their add-ins.

Excel-DNA is free for all use, and distributed under a permissive open-source license that also allows commercial use (the OSI approved zlib license).

Excel-DNA is developed using .NET 2.0, and users have to install the freely available .NET Framework 2.0 runtime (.NET 4 is also supported). The integration is by an Excel Add-In (.xll) that exposes .NET code to Excel. The user code can be in text-based (.dna) script files (Visual Basic, C# or F#), or compiled .NET libraries from any language.
See the GettingStarted.txt file for help in making your first Excel-DNA add-in.
